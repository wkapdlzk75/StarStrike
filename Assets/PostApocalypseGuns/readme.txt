All sounds are no headroom.
If you don't control the volume, distortion will occur.

So, If gun's RPM is fast, You want to lower the volume and channel.
At least keep the volume 0.5 and channel count 4 ~ 8.
Some guns need to use only 2 channel depend on a situation.

Otherwise, Manual firing weapon like a sniper rifle or shotgun, 
You should keep the volume higher than rifles. ( 0.7 ~ 0.9 )
It makes individual shot feels powerful.

You can also use "Crossfade by Distance" technic with 'far' sounds.

All category can be shared.
You can use pistol sound on rifle or sniper rifle on rocket launcher.
So, feel free to experiment.
If you take your time in mixing, gun play will be satisfying.
